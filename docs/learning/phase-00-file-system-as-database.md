# Phase 0 — File System as Database

**Estimated time: 2–3h + ~1h vault/reflect**

!!! warning "Changed 2026-06 (noteapp-alignment round)"
    Phase 0's contract grew: a new `textutil.py` module (`slugify` + `unique_path`) is now
    the single title→filename rule, and `create()` must never overwrite an existing note
    (collisions get numeric suffixes: `my-note-1.md`). New tests: `tests/phase_00/test_textutil.py`
    plus `test_create_same_title_twice_does_not_overwrite`. If you finished this phase before
    the change: run `make skeleton PHASE=0` — it copies the new `textutil.py` stub and never
    touches files you already own — then implement the two functions and route `create()`
    through them. A green recorded by `make resume` before this change predates these tests.

**Core concept:** The file is the database. Not a cache, not a representation — the
file *is* the record. Everything downstream (index, TUI, API) is derived from files
and is expendable. Delete the index: rebuild it from files. The files are never
derived from anything else.

**What makes this non-obvious:** Every database tutorial starts with a schema and
inserts rows. Here the "schema" is a text format with a human-editable header, and
the "insert" is writing a file to disk. The instinct is to treat files as inputs to
a real database. The point of this phase is to break that instinct.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you will be able to:
- Explain what YAML frontmatter is and why it serves as Akanga's node schema instead of a traditional database schema
- Implement a `parse → write → parse` roundtrip that is fully idempotent — no fields reordered, no whitespace added, no encoding changed
- Explain the role of UUID as a stable node identity that survives file renames and title changes
- Implement an atomic file write using `os.replace` and explain why naive `open(..., 'w')` is unsafe

## Quick Start

```bash
make skeleton PHASE=0    # copy the starting code into ./src/
make test PHASE=0        # run the tests (they will fail initially)
make study PHASE=0       # open the tmux study session
```

> First time here? Run `make setup` first, then `direnv allow` to activate the environment.
> See `docs/foundations/makefile-basics.md` for a full Makefile walkthrough.

## Toolbox — Foundation Docs

Three tools you will use throughout this learning path. If you have not used them
before, read these first — each takes 15–20 minutes and you can return here immediately after.

- **Make** — `docs/foundations/makefile-basics.md` — the Makefile is your primary interface to this repo. Every workflow is a `make <target>` call.
- **Direnv** — `docs/foundations/direnv-basics.md` — auto-activates your Python environment and project variables when you `cd` into the repo.
- **MKDocs** — `docs/foundations/mkdocs-basics.md` — renders your Markdown docs as a browsable website. Used in Phase 8 to publish your knowledge graph, available anytime via `make docs-serve`.

## Concepts

### YAML Frontmatter

Structured metadata embedded at the top of a Markdown file, delimited by `---`
lines. The parser reads everything between the first and second `---` as YAML,
everything after as the body. It is Akanga's node schema: UUID, title, type, tags,
and edges all live here. Because it is plain text, it is human-readable,
git-diffable, and editable in any text editor — no proprietary format, no lock-in.

> Akanga node: `YAML Frontmatter`

> → Foundation sidebar: `yaml-and-markdown-frontmatter.md` ("When Would Frontmatter
> Earn a Schema?") — why the vault normalizes user files instead of validating them.

> → Foundation doc: `docs/foundations/yaml-and-markdown-frontmatter.md`

!!! warning "Security: YAML injection and the safe loader"
    PyYAML's default loader can instantiate arbitrary Python objects from tags
    like `!!python/object/apply:os.system` — parsing one malicious frontmatter
    block would execute code on your machine. `python-frontmatter` uses
    `SafeLoader` by default (built-in YAML types only; any `!!python/` tag
    raises `ConstructorError`), which is why this phase is safe out of the box.
    If you ever swap YAML libraries, call `yaml.safe_load` explicitly — never
    bare `yaml.load`.

> and a verification snippet you can run)

> Akanga node: `YAML Injection` — link it to `[[YAML Frontmatter]]` (you'll type
> this edge in Phase 1A)

### UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)

A 128-bit randomly generated identifier (e.g., `a3f7c2be-1234-5678-abcd-ef01`).
The probability of two colliding is ~10⁻³⁷. In Akanga, the UUID is the stable
identity of a node: generated once, written into frontmatter, and never changed
after that — even if the file is renamed, moved, or its title changes. This
makes UUID the correct key for edges, not the filename or title.

"Generated once" has two entry points. `create()` stamps a fresh `uuid.uuid4()`
into every new file. But files can also arrive from outside `create()` — hand-written,
copied from another vault, or with a mangled `id` after a careless edit. The parser
is the safety net: if frontmatter has no `id`, or the `id` is not a valid UUID
string, `parse_node_file()` generates a fresh `uuid4()` for the node. The
never-changes guarantee applies from the moment a valid UUID lands in the
frontmatter — parsing a file that already has a valid `id` must always preserve it.

> Akanga node: `UUID`

### Idempotence

An operation is idempotent if applying it multiple times produces the same result
as applying it once. For the parser, `parse → write → parse` must be idempotent:
reading and writing back a file must not change it. Without this, every save
silently corrupts the file — reordering fields, adding whitespace, changing
encoding. Idempotence is also required for write-back in Phase 1: merging inline
edges into frontmatter repeatedly must not accumulate duplicates.

> Akanga node: `Idempotence`

### Atomic Write

A file write that either fully completes or has no effect — no observable
intermediate state. A naive write (`open(path, 'w')` then stream content) is not
atomic: if the process dies mid-write, the file is left partially written with no
recovery. The atomic pattern writes to a temp file first, then calls
`os.replace(temp, target)` — a single OS syscall that repoints the directory entry at the temp file's inode (names live in the directory, not in the inode). The
reader always sees the old complete file or the new complete file, never a partial
one.

> Akanga node: `Atomic Write`

> → Foundation doc: `docs/foundations/design-patterns.md` (Atomic Write section)

### Content Hash (SHA-256)

A fixed-size fingerprint derived deterministically from file content. SHA-256
produces 256 bits: the same content always gives the same hash; any change gives
a completely different one. In Akanga, the hash is stored in the DB index. When
the file watcher fires, the indexer hashes the changed file and compares to the
stored value — match means skip, difference means re-index. This avoids
unnecessary DB writes on saves that didn't change content.

> Akanga node: `Content Hash`

### Python Dataclass

A class decorated with `@dataclass` that auto-generates `__init__`, `__repr__`,
and `__eq__` from its field declarations. The generated `__eq__` makes
`assert parsed == re_parsed` work in tests without custom comparison code. Can be
made immutable with `@dataclass(frozen=True)` to prevent accidental mutation after
creation.

> Akanga node: `Python Dataclass`

> → Foundation doc: `docs/foundations/python-dataclasses.md`

### Vault Configuration

A single YAML file at the vault root (`akanga.yaml`) that stores vault-level
settings: the vault owner's name (written as `author` on every new node) and the
workspace registry — the list of named workspaces with their UUIDs. The parser
reads it on `create()` to stamp `author` and assign the default workspace.
Keeping config separate from node files means changing your name or renaming a
workspace does not require touching every node — only the config changes, and the
sync queue handles the lazy display-name update in node files.

The default workspace is **Nhamandu** (Mbya Guaraní: the primordial being whose
unfolding thought gave rise to the cosmos — the source before all things). Its
UUID is generated once when the vault is scaffolded (`make vault-init` creates
`akanga.yaml`) and never changes, even if the user renames the workspace.

```yaml
# akanga.yaml
owner: Arthur Pieri
default_workspace:
  name: Nhamandu
  id: a3f7c2be-1234-5678-abcd-ef0123456789   # generated at vault-init, never changes
workspaces:
  - name: ProjectX
    id: b2c3d4e5-abcd-ef01-2345-678901234567
  - name: BookNotes
    id: c3d4e5f6-bcde-f012-3456-789012345678
```

## Vault Nodes to Create

After completing Phase 0, create these 8 nodes in your Akanga vault. Run
`make vault-init` first to scaffold the vault directory and `akanga.yaml`.
The vault is proof of understanding — not just the tests.

At this phase you connect nodes with plain, untyped `[[wikilinks]]` in the prose
body — typed edges (`solves`, `is_part_of`, …) are exactly what you build in
Phase 1A. When you reach 1A, come back and type these links.

| Node | Type | Link to (untyped `[[wikilinks]]` in the body) |
|---|---|---|
| `YAML Frontmatter` | note | `[[Node File Format]]` |
| `UUID` | note | `[[Stable Node Identity]]` |
| `Idempotence` | note | `[[Parser Roundtrip]]` |
| `Atomic Write` | note | `[[Partial Write Corruption]]`; `[[os.replace]]` |
| `Content Hash` | note | `[[SHA-256]]`; `[[Change Detection]]` |
| `Python Dataclass` | note | `[[Node Data Model]]` |
| `os.replace` | reference | `[[Atomic Write]]`; `[[Python Standard Library]]` |
| `Vault Configuration` | note | `[[Default Author Stamping]]`; `[[Vault Structure]]` |

## What You Build

Two modules: `parser.py` and `textutil.py`

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `parse_node_file(path) → Node` | Read `.md` file → `Node` dataclass |
| `write_node_file(path, frontmatter_dict, content)` | Serialize frontmatter + content to `.md` file, atomically |
| `create(title, node_type, vault) → Node` | Generate new node file with fresh UUID; stamps `author` from `akanga.yaml`; filename via `textutil` — collision-safe |
| `content_hash(path) → str` | SHA-256 hex digest of file content |
| `slugify(title) → str` | Lowercase; collapse non-alphanumeric runs to `-`; strip edge hyphens; `"untitled"` fallback |
| `unique_path(vault, slug) → str` | First free filename: `slug.md`, then numeric suffixes — never overwrite an existing note |

Behaviors the test suite enforces beyond the signatures (don't skip these):

- **`parse_node_file` generates a UUID when `id` is missing or invalid.** A file
  with no `id`, or an `id` that is not a valid UUID string, gets a fresh
  `uuid.uuid4()`. A valid existing `id` is always preserved.
- **`type` defaults to `"note"`.** A file without a `type` field parses as
  `type == "note"` — use `frontmatter.get("type", "note")`.
- **`write_node_file` creates missing parent directories.** Writing to
  `vault/subdir/nested/file.md` when `subdir/` does not exist must succeed —
  `os.makedirs(dir_path, exist_ok=True)` before the atomic write.
- **Malformed YAML raises.** A broken frontmatter block (e.g., an unclosed quote)
  must raise an exception, not silently return a half-parsed node.
- **Missing files raise.** `parse_node_file` on a nonexistent path raises
  `FileNotFoundError`/`OSError`.

The canonical frontmatter schema:

```yaml
---
id: a3f7c2be-1234-5678-abcd-ef0123456789
title: Fast Thinking is Unreliable
type: note
tags: [cognition, decision-making]
graph:
  - name: Nhamandu
    id: a3f7c2be-1234-5678-abcd-ef0123456789
  - name: ProjectX
    id: b2c3d4e5-abcd-ef01-2345-678901234567
author: Arthur Pieri
created_at: 2026-05-23
updated_at: 2026-05-23
meta:
  status: draft
edges: []
---
```

`graph` is a list of workspace references — each entry has `name` (display cache,
may become stale after a rename) and `id` (UUID, authoritative, never changes).
This is the same dual-key pattern as edges. Absent or empty `graph` auto-populates
with the default workspace (Nhamandu) on first write-back.

`meta` is an optional block of user-defined key:value pairs — no schema
enforcement. It is stored only in the `.md` file; the Phase 02 DB schema does not
index `meta` as a column (you access it by re-parsing the file).

The `Node` dataclass — this shape is final. The same dataclass carries you
unchanged through Phases 0, 1, and 2 (the DB in Phase 2 simply persists a subset
of these fields):

```python
@dataclass
class Node:
    id: str                   # UUID string — generated once, lives in frontmatter
    title: str
    type: str                 # "note" | "reference"
    tags: list[str]
    content_hash: str = ""    # SHA-256 hex digest — computed at parse/index time
    content: str = ""         # raw markdown body (everything below frontmatter)
    path: str = ""            # runtime only — not written to frontmatter
    frontmatter: dict = field(default_factory=dict)  # the raw parsed YAML dict
```

Fields like `graph`, `author`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `meta`, and `edges`
that appear in the canonical frontmatter schema above are not dedicated dataclass
fields — they are keys in `node.frontmatter` (the raw dict). Only the fields that
the index and the tests need first-class access to get promoted to dataclass fields.

`create()` reads vault config to stamp author and default workspace:

```python
def create(title: str, node_type: str, vault: Path) -> Node:
    config = load_vault_config(vault)  # reads akanga.yaml
    # stamps author, assigns default_workspace as graph[0]
    ...
```

---

## Deliverable

Passing the Phase 0 suite: `make test PHASE=0` runs `tests/phase_00/test_parser.py`
and `tests/phase_00/test_textutil.py`.

!!! tip "Testing pattern: the conformance table"
    `test_textutil.py` asserts one table of input→expected-slug cases instead of
    hand-writing a test per case. The payoff is that SEVERAL implementations can assert
    the SAME table: noteapp replays its shared wikilink case table through both its
    Python core and its TypeScript mirror (and pins its Lua slug mirror to the Python
    source), so the surfaces can't drift apart silently. One table beats N parallel
    hand-written suites — adding a case upgrades every implementation's coverage at once.
    The 16 slug cases are inlined at the top of `tests/phase_00/test_textutil.py`; read
    them before implementing `slugify`.

These are the tests, by name:

**Parsing:**

- `test_parse_basic_frontmatter` — a well-formed file returns `id`, `title`, `type`, and `tags` exactly as written
- `test_parse_generates_uuid_when_missing` — a file without an `id` gets a fresh, valid `uuid4()`
- `test_parse_invalid_uuid_replaced` — an `id` that is not a valid UUID string is replaced with a generated one
- `test_parse_tags_as_list` — `tags` comes back as `list[str]`, never a scalar or None
- `test_parse_default_type_is_note` — a file without a `type` field defaults to `"note"`
- `test_parse_note_type` — an explicit `type: note` parses as `"note"`
- `test_parse_body_content` — the markdown body below the frontmatter is preserved on the node

**Hashing:**

- `test_content_hash_matches_sha256` — the hash is the SHA-256 hex digest of the file's raw bytes
- `test_content_hash_changes_on_edit` — editing the file changes the hash

**Writing:**

- `test_write_node_file_roundtrip` — write → parse preserves `id`, `title`, `type`, and `tags` (idempotence)
- `test_write_is_atomic` — no `*.tmp` files remain after a successful write
- `test_failed_replace_preserves_original_file` — fault injection: when `os.replace` fails mid-write, the original file is untouched and still parses
- `test_write_node_file_to_nonexistent_dir_creates_it` — writing into a missing subdirectory creates it

**Creating:**

- `test_create_writes_file_with_fresh_uuid` — `create()` writes a new `.md` file stamped with a fresh `uuid4()`
- `test_create_stamps_author_from_vault_config` — `create()` reads `akanga.yaml` and stamps `author`
- `test_create_roundtrip` — a created node parses back with the same `id`, `title`, and `type`
- `test_create_same_title_twice_does_not_overwrite` — two `create()` calls with the same title yield two files; the first is untouched

**Slug + collision safety (`test_textutil.py`):**

- `test_slugify_conformance_table` — the 16-case input→slug table (inlined from noteapp's `slug_cases.json`)
- `test_unique_path_no_collision` — a free slug returns `slug.md`
- `test_unique_path_suffixes_in_order` — occupied slugs get `-1`, `-2`, … in order

**Error paths:**

- `test_parse_nonexistent_file_raises` — missing file raises `FileNotFoundError`/`OSError`
- `test_malformed_frontmatter` — broken YAML raises instead of returning a half-parsed node

To see the shape of the contract at a glance, here are three of those tests in
miniature (illustrative — the real suite is `tests/phase_00/`):

```python
def test_roundtrip():
    node = create(title="Fast Thinking is Unreliable", node_type="note", vault=tmp_path)
    parsed = parse_node_file(node.path)
    assert parsed.id == node.id
    assert parsed.title == node.title
    assert parsed.content == node.content
    write_node_file(parsed.path, dict(parsed.frontmatter), parsed.content)
    re_parsed = parse_node_file(parsed.path)
    assert re_parsed == parsed           # write → parse is idempotent

def test_uuid_stability():
    node = create(title="Test", node_type="note", vault=tmp_path)
    original_id = node.id
    content = Path(node.path).read_text().replace("Test", "Test Renamed")
    Path(node.path).write_text(content)
    re_parsed = parse_node_file(node.path)
    assert re_parsed.id == original_id  # UUID unchanged after external edit

def test_atomic_write_leaves_no_temp_files():
    node = create(title="Test", node_type="note", vault=tmp_path)
    write_node_file(node.path, dict(node.frontmatter), node.content)
    temp_files = list(tmp_path.glob("*.tmp"))
    assert temp_files == []
```

Plus the 8 vault nodes from the table above, connected with untyped `[[wikilinks]]`.
The vault is the proof of understanding, not just the tests.

## Reflect

> **Break it on purpose:** Replace your atomic write with a plain
> `path.write_text(content)`. Predict which test fails — write the name down

> **Solo:** You wrote `os.replace(temp, target)` instead of streaming directly to the file. Without looking at the code, explain to yourself in one sentence why this matters. If you can't explain it without using the word "atomic," try again.

> **Group:** The file is described as "the source of truth — never derived from anything else." But the `content_hash` in the DB is derived from the file. Is the hash part of the source of truth, or part of the derived index? Where exactly is the boundary, and does the distinction matter for how you reason about correctness?
